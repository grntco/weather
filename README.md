# Weather

This is a weather app for The Odin Project's JavaScript course. I learned to work with APIs, using the free tier of the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/), and practice Promises with async/await. I also used Webpack once again to continue to become familiar with it.

A user can search for a city to see its weather data, including hourly and daily (up to three days) of temperatures and conditions. 

Design inspired by Apple's weather app.
